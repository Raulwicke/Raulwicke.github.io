				<p> Since 2010, the stories of Frustengrad and the world of Moira have been told around kitchen tables, during long car rides, and at D&D Sessions. The heroes of these stories have ranged from the epic adventures of Salgood Ra to the often times hilarious exploits of Quyn, Felk Siplace, and Mother. </p>
				<p> In 2018 the first game of the <i>Legends of Frustengrad</i> met and the story began anew with the <i>Magnificent Bastards</i>, who in turn gave way to <i>Fate's Miscreants</i>, whose stories can be listened to in the Campaign Recordings.</p>
				<p> The stories continued to grow with the adventures of the <i>99th Corps</i> and the <i>Cabill Rose Academy</i> in late 2019. And in early 2020 the narrative universe grew with the introduction of the novelization of character backstories and histories, and finally culminating in this project.</p>
